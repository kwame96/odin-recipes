    <h2>Homemade Cheesy Mac and Cheese</h2>
    <p>Baked mac and cheese. It’s nearly the universal comfort food, and there are SO many variations! In fact, I almost
        didn’t post this recipe, as there are SOOOO many mac and cheese recipes available, and most people already have
        their favorite way of making it.</p>
    <p>Of course, there’s no “right” way or “wrong” way, so I’m here sharing the way I like to make my mac and cheese
        (the way my family loves it too).</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb. Dried Elbow Pasta</li>

        <li>4 Cups Grated Medium Sharp Cheddar Cheese</li>
        <li>2 Cups Grated Gruyere Cheese </li>

    <br>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil the pasta, drain</li>
        <li>Make the cheese sauce by combining a fat (butter), and starch (flour), then whisking in the milk products
        </li>
